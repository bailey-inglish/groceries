PWA Icon Placeholder Files

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add icon files:

1. icon-192.png - 192x192 pixel PNG icon
2. icon-512.png - 512x512 pixel PNG icon

You can create these icons using any image editor or online tools like:

- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

Recommended icon design:
- Simple, recognizable symbol (e.g., shopping cart or grocery bag)
- High contrast colors
- Clean, minimal design that works at small sizes

For now, the app will work but may show default browser icons until these are added.
