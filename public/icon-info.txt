PWA Icon Setup Instructions

The PWA manifest is currently configured without icons to avoid errors.
Once you create icons, update the manifest.json to include them.

To add icons:

1. Create two PNG icon files:
   - icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
   - icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

2. Place them in the /public directory

3. Update manifest.json to include the icons section:

"icons": [
  {
    "src": "/icon-192.png",
    "sizes": "192x192",
    "type": "image/png",
    "purpose": "any maskable"
  },
  {
    "src": "/icon-512.png",
    "sizes": "512x512",
    "type": "image/png",
    "purpose": "any maskable"
  }
]

Icon Creation Tools:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Canva, Figma, or any image editor

Recommended Design:
- Simple, recognizable symbol (e.g., shopping cart 🛒 or grocery bag 🛍️)
- High contrast colors
- Clean, minimal design that works at small sizes
- Use your brand colors (currently blue #3b82f6)

Until icons are added, the app will work but browsers will use default placeholder icons.
